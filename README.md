# Algorithms Sandbox In Java

A sanbox for classical algorithms, such as searching and sorting algorithms, with my implementation in Java. 

Starting from implemenation for integer arrays, I will try to upgrade all searching and sorting methods to generic methods.

Test programs are written as junit test cases.

In this repo I have

Searching algorithms:
- Generic Linear search.
- Generic Binary search.

Sorting algorithms:
- Generic Selection sort.
- Generic Insertion sort.
- Generic Binary insertion sort.
- Generic Interchange sort.
- Generic Bubble sort.
- Generic Shaker sort.
- Generic Heap sort.
- Generic Shell sort.
- Generic Quick sort.
- Generic Merge sort (tc failed).
- Radix sort (still not generic).
