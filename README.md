# AlgorithmsSandbox

Classical algorithms, such as searching and sorting algorithms, with my implementation in Java. 

Test programs are written as junit test cases.

In this repo I have

Searching algorithms:
- Generic Linear search.
- Generic Binary search.

Sorting algorithms:
- Selection sort.
- Insertion sort.
- Binary insertion sort.
- Interchange sort.
- Bubble sort.
- Shaker sort.
- Heap sort.
- Shell sort.
- Quick sort.
- Merge sort.
- Radix sort.
